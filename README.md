picpwm
======

This is some basic PWM code I put together for a PIC18F4550 (I think). The rows and columns are multiplexed using shift registers (which are fed SPI signal directly instead of being bit-banged). 

Anyways, it works pretty well -- I just wanted to roll my own for the sake of learning how to do PWM in a structured way.
